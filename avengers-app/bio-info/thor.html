  <h4>Early Life</h4>
    <p>
     Thor was born approximately 1500 years ago to Odin, the King of Asgard, and Frigga.
      He was raised on Asgard as the crown prince, alongside his brother, Loki.
    </p>
       <h4>Banishment To Earth</h4>
      <p>
       In 2011, Thor prepares to ascend to the throne, but Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket of Ancient Winters, 
       an artifact seized by Odin in a war centuries before. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Frost Giant leader Laufey,
       accompanied by Loki, childhood friend Sif, and the Warriors Three: Voltstagg, Fandral, and Hogun.
       A battle ensues until Odin intervenes, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. 
       For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth. Odin casts an enchantment on Mjolnir, 
       ensuring that only those who are worthy may wield the hammer. Thor lands in New Mexico, meeting scientist Dr. Erik Selvig, astrophysicist Dr. 
       Jane Foster, and Foster's intern Darcy Lewis. Thor resigns himself to exile on Earth, where he develops a relationship with Foster. 
       Odin enters the "Odinsleep", a period of rest needed to maintain his power, and Loki, having learned he is actually an adopted Frost Giant, 

       seizes the Asgardian throne and prepares to conquer the Nine Realms. 
       The Warriors Three and Sif find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, 
       prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's selflessness proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir.
       The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. 
       Thor returns to Asgard and fights Loki before destroying the Bifröst Bridge to stop Loki's plans,
       stranding himself in Asgard. Odin prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss, 
       but Loki appears to commit suicide when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to rule.
      </p>
      <h4>Joining The Avengers</h4>
      <p>
        In 2012, Odin sends Thor back to Earth using dark magic after learning Loki is alive and is attempting to conquer the Earth. 
        He finds Loki on a Quinjet, held captive by Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, and Natasha Romanoff. 
        Thor takes Loki away, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan. However, Stark and Rogers pursue Thor and after a brief confrontation, 
        Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier. Agents 
        including Clint Barton, who were mind controlled by Loki, attack the Helicarrier, 

        disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Bruce Banner to transform into the Hulk.
        Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage and both are ejected from the Helicarrier as Loki escapes. 
        Thor then becomes a founding member of the Avengers upon returning to help Rogers, Stark, Banner, Romanoff,
        and Barton when Loki uses the Tesseract to open a wormhole over New York City to allow a Chitauri army to invade.
        Thor and the Avengers fight off the Chitauri and save the city. After Loki is defeated at Stark Tower, 
        Thor returns to Asgard with Loki and the Tesseract.
      </p>
      <h4>Battle With The Dark Elves</h4>
      <p>
        In 2013, having used the Tesseract to rebuild the Bifrost and bring the Nine Realms to peace, 
        Thor and his fellow warriors learn that the Convergence of the realms is imminent, with portals linking the worlds appearing at random. 
        Heimdall alerts Thor that Jane Foster has left his near all-seeing vision,
        leading Thor to go to Earth. Jane inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard.
        Odin recognizes this force as a weapon known as the Aether, warning that it will kill Jane, and that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.
        The Dark Elves, led by Malekith, attack Asgard, searching for Jane. Thor's mother Frigga is killed protecting Jane,

        and Malekith is forced to flee. Against Odin's orders to stay in Asgard, Thor reluctantly frees Loki, who knows a secret portal to Svartalfheim,
        home of the Dark Elves, in return for Thor's promise to take vengeance for their mother. 
        In Svartalfheim, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. 
        Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded. Thor and Jane return to London through another portal.
        Thor ultimately defeats Malekith in a battle in Greenwich, and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to take the throne, 
        and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. Thor then returns to Earth and reunites with Jane.
      </p>
      <h4>Ultron And The Battle Of Sokovia</h4>
      <p>
       In 2015, Thor and the Avengers raid a Hydra facility in Sokovia and find Loki's scepter.
       Back at Avengers Tower, Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem,
       and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "Ultron" global defense program. 
       After the Avengers host a celebratory party and Thor reveals he and Jane have ended their relationship,
       the unexpectedly sentient Ultron attacks Thor, James Rhodes, and the other Avengers before escaping with the scepter. 
       The team tracks Ultron down in Johannesburg, but Wanda Maximoff subdues them with hallucinatory visions. Following this, 
       Thor and the team go to Barton's home to recover, however, 

       Thor leaves them in order to consult with Selvig on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination.
       Thor and Selvig go to a mystical well, where Thor has a vision of the Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence.
       Returning to the Tower, Thor finds out that Stark secretly uploaded J.A.R.V.I.S. 
       into a synthetic vibranium body captured from Ultron and helps activate the body, dubbed the Vision, 
       explaining that the gem on his forehead is one of the six Infinity Stones. 
       Thor and the team return to Sokovia where they engage in the final battle against Ultron and manage to defeat him.
       At the new Avengers Compound, 
       Thor tells Rogers and Stark that he is leaving to go back into space to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events 
       and leaves Earth using the Bifrost.
      </p>
      <h4>Ragnarok</h4>
      <p>
        In 2017, Thor is imprisoned in Muspelheim by Surtur. Surtur claims he will destroy Asgard in the prophesied Ragnarök,
        when his crown is placed into the Eternal Flame in Odin's vault. Thor escapes, fights and defeats Surtur and retrieves the crown, 
        believing he has prevented Ragnarök. While returning the crown to Asgard, he finds Loki still alive and posing as Odin. 
        He takes Loki back to New York City. With the help of Stephen Strange, they find a dying Odin in Norway, 
        who explains that his passing will allow his firstborn child, Hela, to escape from a prison she was sealed in millennia ago. She appears, 
        destroys Mjolnir and forces Thor and Loki from the Bifrost out into space. 
        Thor crash-lands on the planet Sakaar, and is captured by Valkyrie, 
        a former member of the ancient Asgardian order of Valkyries defeated by Hela. 
        Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmaster's Tournament of Champions and he befriends fellow gladiators, Korg and Miek.

        After the fight with Hulk, Thor finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. 
        A video recording of Romanoff helps Hulk transform back into Banner and after convincing Valkyrie and Loki to help, 
        they escape through a wormhole to Asgard but not before Loki betrays his brother, and is left behind on Sakaar.
        In the midst of the battle with Hela's forces, Loki returns aboard the Grandmaster's vessel, 
        the Statesman. He and Heimdall help Asgardians escape into the ship. Thor, facing Hela, 
        loses an eye and through a vision of Odin realizes his true potential 
        and unlocks his hidden powers but soon realises that Ragnarok is the only way to stop Hela.
        He has Loki place Surtur's crown in the Eternal Flame, 
        and Surtur destroys Asgard and Hela. Thor, crowned king, decides to take his people to Earth,
        but they are intercepted by Sanctuary II, Thanos' warship.
      </p>
      <h4>Combating Thanos And The Infinity War</h4>
      <p>
       On a destroyed Statesman, Thor is threatened by Thanos using the Power Stone, until Loki gives him the Space Stone within the Tesseract.
       Before he does, he calls on the Hulk, but Thanos overpowers Hulk and kills Heimdall. After Loki is killed by Thanos, 
       Thor clutches his brother's body as Thanos obliterates the Statesman leaving Thor to die in the open space. 
       Thor survives and is rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy — Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Mantis, Rocket, 
       and Groot — and they tell Thor about Thanos' quest to find the Infinity Stones and erase half of all life in the universe. 
       Needing a new weapon, Thor leaves in a space pod with Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir, and Rocket gives Thor a cybernetic replacement eye. 
       They find that Nidavellir has been ravaged by Thanos and meet the dwarf king Eitri. 

       Thor repairs the damaged forge, and they work together to create Stormbreaker, 
       a powerful axe that also grants Thor the power of the Bifrost. 
       Thor transports himself, Rocket, and Groot to Wakanda on Earth to help Rogers, Romanoff, Banner, Rhodes, Sam Wilson, Bucky Barnes, T'Challa, 
       and the Wakandan army in the battle against the Outriders. 
       Thor is able to defeat scores of Outriders and uses Stormbreaker to severely wound Thanos in the chest.
       However, Thanos tells Thor that he should have gone for the head and manages to activate the completed Infinity Gauntlet by snapping his fingers,
       initiating the Blip. Thanos teleports away and Thor is left to watch in horror when Barnes, Maximoff, Wilson, T'Challa, and Groot disintegrate.
      </p>
      <h4>Avenging The Fallen And The Time Heist</h4>
      <p>
       Thor, along with the surviving Avengers and Rocket, return to the Avengers Compound to assess the damage.
       Three weeks later, Thor goes with Rogers, Romanoff, Banner, Rhodes, Rocket, Carol Danvers and Nebula into space to Titan II to confront Thanos.
       After discovering that Thanos destroyed the Stones to prevent further use, an enraged Thor decapitates him with Stormbreaker. 
       Sometime between 2018 and 2023, Thor and the remaining Asgardians settle in Tønsberg, Norway where they create a colony called New Asgard. 
       Thor becomes an overweight alcoholic as a result of his trauma.

       In 2023, Rocket and Banner arrive in New Asgard and urge Thor to return to the Avengers and hear their plan to undo Thanos' actions.
       Thor returns to the Compound, reuniting with the Avengers, 
       and learns of the plan to time travel via the Quantum Realm to collect the Infinity Stones from different points in the past.
       He and Rocket travel to Asgard in an alternate 2013 where he meets an alternate Frigga, who reignites Thor's sense of purpose, 
       and he regains an alternate version of Mjolnir. Upon returning, the original Avengers hold a silent mourning for Romanoff,
       who sacrificed herself to obtain the Soul Stone. After Banner restores the lives Thanos erased, 
       an alternate version of Thanos from 2014 travels through the Quantum Tunnel and attacks the Avengers Compound. 
       Thor, Stark and Rogers confront and battle Thanos. After the restored Avengers, Guardians, Asgardians, Ravagers, 
       Masters of the Mystic Arts and the Wakandan army arrive, Thor participates in the final battle against Thanos and his army. 
       In the end, Stark sacrifices himself to kill Thanos and his forces. Afterward, Thor attends Stark's funeral. 
       While Rogers returns the alternate Stones and Mjolnir to their respective timelines, Thor returns to New Asgard, 
       where he makes Valkyrie the new ruler and leaves with the Guardians of the Galaxy into space.
      </p>
      <h4>Fighting Gorr The God Butcher And Beyond</h4>
      <p>
       Thor spends a period of time with the Guardians of the Galaxy and reattains his muscular physique. 
       In 2024, Thor helps them fight off an alien army on the planet Indigarr. 
       Afterwards, they learn of distress calls throughout the galaxy and he parts ways with them to respond to a distress signal from Sif.
       Upon arrival, a beaten Sif warns Thor of Gorr, a being possessing the god-killing weapon, 
       the Necrosword, seeking the extinction of all gods and that his next target is New Asgard.

       Dr. Jane Foster, Thor's ex-girlfriend who is diagnosed with terminal cancer arrives at New Asgard in hopes of seeking medical treatment.
       Thor's destroyed hammer Mjolnir re-forges and bonds itself to Foster,
       granting her its power after years earlier Thor had unknowingly enchanted it to protect her.
       Thor arrives in New Asgard just as Gorr starts attacking the town with shadow creatures. 
       He is surprised to find Foster with Mjolnir but nevertheless teams up with her, Valkyrie and Korg to fight Gorr. 
       The group thwarts Gorr, but he escapes, kidnapping several Asgardian children.
       The group travels to Omnipotent City to warn the other gods and ask for their help. The Olympian god Zeus is unwilling to help and has Thor captured,
       forcing the group to fight off Zeus's men. Zeus injures Korg; in anger, Thor impales Zeus with his own thunderbolt, 
       which Valkyrie steals during their escape. They then travel to the Shadow Realm to save the children. However,
       this turned out to be a ruse for Gorr to take Stormbreaker, 
       which he intends to use on the Bifrost to enter Eternity and ask for the destruction of all gods.
       Gorr manages to overpower Thor's group and successfully steal Stormbreaker. Gorr uses Stormbreaker to open the portal to Eternity.
       Valkyrie is badly injured and Foster ends the battle drained by her use of Mjolnir, which has exacerbated her cancer. Thor goes alone, 
       using Zeus's thunderbolt to imbue the kidnapped Asgardian children with his power to fight alongside him. 
       Foster arrives and joins Thor in fighting Gorr and destroys the Necrosword.
       Admitting defeat, Thor manages to convince Gorr that all he wanted from Eternity was not to destroy the gods but to get his daughter back.
       Foster succumbs to her illness and dies in Thor's arms. Eternity allows Gorr's request to revive Love,
       and he asks Thor to take care of before he dies. The children return to New Asgard, where Valkyrie and Sif begin training them.
       Meanwhile, by 2025, Thor, now once again in possession of Mjolnir, continues to go on adventures to planets to help people,
       with Love (who calls him her "Uncle Thor"), now wielding Stormbreaker, by his side.
       At some later, unspecified point in time, Thor would meet mutant mercenary Wade Wilson and comfort him in his arms after being wounded.
