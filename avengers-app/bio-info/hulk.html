   <h4>Origin</h4>
    <p>
     Dr. Robert Bruce Banner is a renowned scientist, physicist, and medical doctor with seven Ph.D.s.
     While working at Culver University, Virginia, Banner meets with General Thaddeus Ross, the father of his colleague and girlfriend Betty, 
     regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to gamma radiation, a field in which Banner is an expert. 
     The experiment, part of the World War II-era supersoldier program that Ross hopes to recreate, fails, 
     and the exposure to the gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the Hulk for the first time. The Hulk goes on a rampage, 
     destroying the lab, killing three people and injuring several others. Banner subsequently becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military,
     particularly Ross, who wants to weaponize the Hulk process.
     </p>
       <h4>Fugitive</h4>
      <p>
      Five years later in 2010, Banner works at a soda bottling factory in Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro while searching for a cure for his condition,
      collaborating on the internet with a colleague he knows only as "Mr. Blue", and to whom he is "Mr. Green".
      He also learns yoga techniques to help keep The Hulk under control and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger,
      a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, giving him gamma sickness.
      Ross tracks down Banner, sending a special forces team led by Russian-born British Royal Marine Emil Blonsky to capture him. 
      Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. Blonsky agrees to be injected with a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, 
      strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.
      Banner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, but is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces,
      again transforming into the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, 
      he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. 
      Mr. Blue, revealed to be cellular biologist Dr. Samuel Sterns, has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. 
      After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. 
      Sterns reveals he has synthesized Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, 
      with the intention of applying its "limitless potential" to medicine.
      Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.
      Banner is caught, and Blonsky has Sterns use Banner's blood to turn him into the Abomination. Blonsky then rampages through Harlem.
      Realizing that only the Hulk can stop Blonsky, Banner jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. 
      After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky and flees. Banner soon ends his relationship with Betty, 
      realizing it can no longer work. A month later, in Bella Coola, British Columbia, Banner successfully transforms in a controlled manner.
      </p>
      <h4>Member of The Avengers</h4>
      <p>
       In 2012, Banner's appearance is differently changed, he is working as a doctor in Calcutta when he is approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. 
       agent Natasha Romanoff, who recruits him to help trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. 
       Going with Romanoff, Banner is introduced to Steve Rogers and S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury.
       He is on the Quinjet when Loki is captured by Tony Stark and Rogers. After Loki's brother Thor agrees to place Loki in a cell on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s 
       Helicarrier, agents including Clint Barton mind-controlled by Loki attack the Helicarrier,
       causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and almost kill Romanoff. 
       Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, with Hulk falling to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet.
       In New York City, Banner meets up with Rogers, Stark, Thor, Romanoff, and Barton,
       becoming a founding member of the Avengers. 
       After the alien species of the Chitauri invade, Banner reveals to Rogers that he is "always angry", 
       immediately transforming into the Hulk and stopping a Leviathan. During the battle, he fights the Chitauri, 
       beats Loki into submission in Stark Tower, and saves Stark from crashing into the ground after losing power through the wormhole.
       After the Battle of New York, Banner forms a close friendship with Stark and works with him closely,
       even requesting him to build an anti-Hulk armor to stop him in case he loses control and goes on a rampage. In 2013, 
       Stark shared stories of his experience with the Extremis formula with Banner while they are relaxing in the Tower, seeking advice.
       Banner falls asleep during it, stating that he was not "that kind of doctor".
       In 2015, Banner and the Avengers raid a Hydra facility in Sokovia and retrieve the scepter. 
       At the Avengers Tower, Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem,
       and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "Ultron" global defense program. 
       After a celebratory party, Ultron becomes sentient and attacks Banner and the Avengers at the Tower,
       before escaping. In Johannesburg, Banner and the Avengers try to stop Ultron, 
       but are subdued by Wanda Maximoff who uses haunting visions to cause the Hulk to rampage in the city until Stark stops him with his Hulkbuster armor.
       Banner and the Avengers travel to Barton's home to recover, where Romanoff and Banner develop a mutual attraction. While there, 
       Fury arrives and persuades the Avengers to make a plan to stop Ultron, resulting in Romanoff being captured and taken to Sokovia. 
       Back at the Avengers Tower, Banner and the others have a confrontation after they learn about the creation of the Vision, but after Thor powers him,
       they learn Vision is an ally. Banner leaves the team to rescue Romanoff and transforms into the Hulk in order to fight Ultron. 
       After the final battle with Ultron in Sokovia, the Hulk departs in a Quinjet and leaves Earth.
      </p>
      <h4>Sakaar And Ragnarok</h4>
      <p>
       After Hulk is lost in space, the Quinjet crash lands on the landfill planet Sakaar. 
       He is taken in by the Grandmaster of Sakaar, who forces him to fight against other contestants in gladiatorial combat. He rises the ranks,
       remaining undefeated and winning the admiration of the people of Sakaar, and becoming the Grandmaster's "Champion".
       In 2017, Hulk fights the next contestant, Thor, who had crashed on the planet and had been captured by Valkyrie. Summoning lightning,
       Thor gains the upper hand on Hulk, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. 
       Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk to help him save Asgard from Ragnarok, 
       and then escapes the palace to find the crashed remains of the Quinjet. 
       Hulk follows Thor to the Quinjet, where a recording of Romanoff makes him transform back into Banner for the first time in two years.
       Banner is shocked to learn that he is in space and expresses fear that if he becomes Hulk again, 
       he will never be able to return to his human form. Banner and Thor work with Valkyrie and Loki to escape Sakaar to Asgard, 
       where Banner becomes Hulk again to save refugee Asgardians from the giant wolf, Fenris. 
       As Asgard is destroyed by Surtur, Hulk accompanies Thor, Valkyrie, Loki, and the Asgardians on the Statesman, a Sakaaran vessel bound for Earth.
      </p>
      <h4>Infinity War</h4>
      <p>
       In 2018, Thanos and the Children of Thanos intercept the Statesman to extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract.
       Hulk fights Thanos, but is overpowered. Heimdall uses the Bifr√∂st Bridge to send Hulk straight to Earth, 
       and Hulk crash-lands at the New York Sanctum of Stephen Strange and Wong in New York City, 
       reverting to Banner. Banner then warns Strange about Thanos, who contacts Stark.
       When Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian arrive in New York in pursuit of the Time Stone, Banner tries to become the Hulk, but is unable to do so;
       Hulk is no longer willing to emerge out of fear. 
       He goes to the Avengers Compound for the first time reuniting with James Rhodes and later with Rogers, Romanoff, Sam Wilson, Maximoff, 
       and Vision. He joins the team to Wakanda on their Quinjet, 
       where he uses Stark's Hulkbuster armor to battle the Outriders and manages to get the upper hand on Obsidian.
       He is pleased when Thor, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot arrive to help. 
       In the forest, he witnesses Thanos's arrival, and is promptly trapped in rocks by Thanos and unable to fight back. 
       After Thanos activates the Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away, Banner is a survivor of the Blip.
       Banner, the surviving Avengers, and Rocket return to the Compound and are shortly met by Carol Danvers.
       Afterwards, Banner, Rogers, Romanoff, Rhodes, Rocket, and Potts witness Danvers returning Stark and Nebula back to the Compound.
       Banner reunites with him, helping him get sedated and rest.
       He then accompanies the surviving Avengers, Danvers, 
       Rocket, and Nebula back into space to the planet Titan II to confront Thanos only to find out he destroyed the Infinity Stones.
      </p>
      <h4>Time Heist</h4>
      <p>
      In between 2018 and 2023, Banner undergoes gamma experimentation to balance his two sides in a remote beach house lab located in Mexico 
      built by Stark. By 2023, he is now permanently in the body of the Hulk but with the mind and voice of Banner. He meets Rogers, Romanoff,
      and Scott Lang at a diner and agrees to help them with their quantum time-travel plan. 
      At the Avengers Compound, they try to time-travel Lang using the quantum tunnel in Lang's borrowed van but are unsuccessful. 
      After Stark arrives and offers his help, 
      Banner and Rocket travel to Norway in the Benatar to New Asgard. 
      Banner reunites with Valkyrie and meets Korg and Miek at Thor's hut, while recruiting a depressed drunken Thor to return to help the Avengers. 
      Back at the Compound, the Avengers formulate a plan to retrieve alternate Infinity Stones.
      Banner, Rogers, Stark, and Lang time-travel via the Quantum Realm to an alternate 2012 in New York City.
      There Banner gets the Time Stone from an alternate variant of the Ancient One
     (to whom he promises to return the Stones to their respective periods in time when the Avengers are done with their mission).
      Banner then returns to the main timeline, but is devastated to learn of Romanoff's death, who had to sacrifice herself to retrieve the Soul Stone.
      After mourning her with the original Avengers, Banner, Stark, and Rocket combine the Stones with the Nano-Gauntlet.
      Banner then volunteers to activate the Infinity Stones, citing his general strength and his specific resistance to gamma radiation.
      He does so and reverses the Blip, though his right arm gets seriously injured in the process. 
      After doing so, an alternate version of Thanos emerges from the quantum realm and bombs the Compound, causing Banner, Rocket, 
      and Rhodes to be trapped in rubble, until they are saved by Lang. 
      He then takes part in the final battle against alternate Thanos and his alien army, 
      who are eventually defeated when Stark uses the Infinity Stones, at the cost of his own life. 
      A week later, Banner attends Stark's funeral, 
      and then prepares a new quantum portal so that Rogers can return the alternate Infinity Stones and Mjolnir.
      He, Bucky Barnes, and Wilson witness an elderly Rogers return and give a new version of the shield to Wilson.
     </p>
      <h4>Meeting Shang-Chi</h4>
      <p>
       By 2024, Banner creates a device to heal his arm, keeping him in human form, 
       [better source needed] and wears a sling due to the injury he sustained while reversing the Blip, though the scarring has healed. 
       That year, Banner, along with Danvers, is called by Wong via hologram to speak with Shang-Chi about the ten rings that belonged to his father.
       Banner welcomes Shang-Chi to the team before leaving the call.
      </p>
      <h4>Training Jeniffer And Meeting His Son</h4>
      <p>
      Banner and his cousin, lawyer Jennifer Walters, go on a road trip in California but are intercepted by a Sakaaran eight-courier craft ship,
      causing Walters to crash the car. Banner bleeds, and his blood is accidentally cross-contaminated with Walters',
      resulting in Walters transforming into a Hulk and running away; 
      Banner eventually retrieves her and uses the lethal gamma dose she took to completely heal his arm. In Mexico,
      Banner trains Walters on controlling her Hulk form, however she rejects the idea of being a superhero and wants to return to her legal career.
      The pair get into a fight and Banner eventually accepts Walters wanting to leave and bids her farewell.
      In 2025, Banner takes off in the Sakaaran spaceship to investigate the message from the car crash and return to Sakaar; while there, 
      he receives a call from Walters and encourages her to take on the case of representing Blonsky, as they have made amends. 
      Banner also indicates approval of Walters' new superhero name "She-Hulk", given to her by the media, 
      saying that "She-Hulk, attorney-at-law" has a nice ring to it.
      Later, Banner returns to Earth with his son, Skaar. 
      They crash a family gathering in Los Angeles where he introduces Skaar to Walters, her parents, their cousin, aunts and uncles, and Matt Murdock.
