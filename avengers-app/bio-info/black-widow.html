  <h4>Early Life</h4>
    <p>
      Natalia Alianovna Romanova (Russian: Наталья Альяновна Романова) was born on December 3, 
      1984, in the Soviet Union, and was trained as a KGB spy in a secretive academy called 
      oom which included training as a ballerina as a cover,[78] as well as the eventual sterilization of the students.[79] 
      She grew up in a false family with Alexei Shostakov and Melina Vostokoff as her 'parents' and Yelena Belova as her younger 
      'sister'.[80] In 1995, when Shostakov completes his assigned mission to steal intel from S.H.I.E.L.D. in Ohio, the family 
      escape to Cuba where they rendezvous with their boss, General Dreykov, who has Romanoff and Belova put through the Red Room 
      or further training to become assassins.
      
      Eventually, Clint Barton is sent to kill Romanoff, 
      but instead chooses to spare her life and recruit her to S.H.I.E.L.D., 
      enabling Romanoff to defect from the USSR and escape her previous life.[c] In Budapest, 
      with Barton's help, Romanoff rigs a bomb in an attempt to kill Dreykov, 
      seemingly killing his daughter Antonia in the process.
      
      In 2009, Romanoff was sent on a mission to Odessa to protect a scientist,
      but was confronted by the Winter Soldier. Romanoff attempted to cover the scientist,
      but the Winter Soldier killed him by shooting him through Romanoff's stomach.[d]
     </p>
       <h4>Uncover for S.H.I.E.L.D.</h4>
      <p>
        In 2010, after Tony Stark publicly becomes Iron Man and appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts as CEO of Stark Industries, 
        he hires Romanoff, who is posing as Stark employee Natalie Rushman on behalf of Nick Fury, 
        director of S.H.I.E.L.D., to replace Potts as his personal assistant. Fury later reveals this to Stark, 
        and Romanoff then helps Stark to thwart the plans of villains Justin Hammer and Ivan Vanko, the latter of whom has remotely 
        taken control of an army of military drones and the armor of Stark's friend James Rhodes. Romanoff successfully defeats Hammer's
         security forces to return control of the Rhodes' armor, allowing Stark and Rhodes to defeat Vanko and the drones.
      </p>
      <h4>Battle Of New York</h4>
      <p>
        In 2012, Romanoff is being interrogated by Russian criminals when Agent Phil Coulson contacts her to inform her that Barton
         has been compromised. Romanoff promptly overcomes the Russians, whom she had only allowed to capture her in order to 
         extract information. After Fury reactivates the "Avengers Initiative", she goes to Kolkata and recruits Bruce Banner to 
         use his expertise to track the gamma signature of the Tesseract. She is introduced to Steve Rogers by Coulson and pilots a 
         Quinjet to Stuttgart where Stark and Rogers have a confrontation with Loki who surrenders. While Loki is held prisoner on a
         S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, Romanoff manipulates him into revealing his plan to cause Banner to become the Hulk. Barton and 
         Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier and Banner transforms and chases Romanoff until he is stopped by Thor. 
         Romanoff fights Barton and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, 
         and Hulk assemble as the Avengers in defense of Loki's next target, New York City. There they fight against the alien race called the 
         Chitauri and ultimately defeat Loki. Afterwards, she and Barton leave together.
      </p>
      <h4>Dismantling Hydra</h4>
      <p>
        In 2014, Romanoff and Rogers are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s counter-terrorism S.T.R.I.K.E. team to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. 
        vessel from Georges Batroc and his mercenaries. Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's
         computers for Fury. After an attempt on Fury's life, Rogers becomes a fugitive hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., and meets with Romanoff. 
         Using data in the flash drive, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer 
         containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola. Zola reveals that ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after World War II, 
         Hydra has secretly operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in 
         exchange for security. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and realize that Secretary of 
         Internal Security Alexander Pierce is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D. They take shelter with Rogers' new friend Sam Wilson, 
         who joins them to stop Hydra. They are attacked by the Winter Soldier and Romanoff is shot through the shoulder but survives. Later,
         to prevent Hydra from using three Helicarriers to murder millions, Romanoff, disguised as a World Security Council member, disarms 
         Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing 
         Hydra to the public. Romanoff later appears before a U.S. Senate subcommittee to defend her and Rogers' actions. Soon after, Romanoff 
         recovers a Hydra file on the Winter Soldier (who is revealed to be Bucky Barnes) and gives it to Rogers and Wilson before leaving.
      </p>
      <h4>Ultron And The Sokovia Accords</h4>
      <p>
        In 2015, Romanoff and the other Avengers attack a Hydra facility in Sokovia where they recover Loki's scepter and encounter Wanda Maximoff
         and her twin brother Pietro. At the Avengers Tower, Romanoff attends the celebratory party and witnesses Ultron's first attack. 
         She and the team go to Johannesburg to stop Ultron, but Maximoff subdues Romanoff, causing her to see visions of her time at the Red Room.
          Afterwards, she and the others find refuge at Barton's home, where she is greeted by his children who call her "Aunty Nat". 
          She and Banner discuss their romantic feelings toward one another and consider going into hiding together. She, Rogers, 
          and Barton travel to Seoul to stop Ultron from transferring his network into a vibranium body powered by the Mind Stone. 
          They succeed but she is taken hostage by Ultron and held in Sokovia. Barton communicates with her using morse code and 
          she is later rescued by Banner, who attempts to get Romanoff to leave with him. Romanoff kisses him, but decides that they should 
          stay and pushes him off a ledge to trigger a transformation into the Hulk. She rallies with the other Avengers and Vision in the battle 
          against Ultron. Following their victory, she and Rogers form a new team in upstate New York at 
          the Avengers Compound consisting of Wilson, Rhodes, Maximoff, and Vision.
          In 2016, she joins Rogers, Wilson, and Maximoff on a mission in Lagos to stop the mercenary Brock Rumlow from obtaining a bioweapon. 
          Romanoff succeeds in securing it, but Maximoff mistakenly kills Wakandan humanitarian workers while protecting Rogers from Rumlow's 
          suicide bomb, triggering the passage of the Sokovia Accords, giving the United Nations command of the Avengers. She comforts Rogers after
          Peggy Carter's funeral and is present in Vienna where the accords were to be ratified and survives 
          the bombing that kills Wakandan King T'Chaka, T'Challa's father. She initially sides with Stark who supports the accords, 
          accompanying him with Rhodes, Vision, T'Challa and Peter Parker to subdue Rogers's team consisting of Barnes, Barton, Wilson, Maximoff, 
          and Scott Lang at Leipzig/Halle Airport in Germany. While there, she changes her mind and allows Rogers and Barnes to escape.
          T'Challa reports her betrayal to U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, which puts her at odds with Stark and forces her to go into hiding.
      </p>
      <h4>Confronting Her Past</h4>
      <p>
        As a fugitive from the United Nations, 
        Romanoff escapes from Ross and flees to a safehouse in Norway where she reunites with her contact Rick Mason. 
        Yelena Belova sends a mind control antidote to Romanoff's safehouse in the hopes that Romanoff will return to help her. 
        As Romanoff unknowingly drives off with the antidote, she is attacked by Taskmaster. 
        Romanoff evades Taskmaster and learns that the antidote came from Belova. They reunite in Budapest, 
        but are then attacked by various Widows. Romanoff learns that General Dreykov is still alive, and that the Red Room is still active.
        Romanoff and Belova break Alexei Shostakov out of prison, and connect with Melina Vostokoff, 
        before being captured and returned to the Red Room. As Dreykov congratulates Vostokoff on finding them, 
        it is revealed that Vostokoff and Romanoff used face masking technology to plan their own capture and switch places. 
        Romanoff learns that Taskmaster is Antonia Dreykov, 
        who suffered damage so severe that Dreykov was forced to put a chip in her head to save her while also turning her into a mind-controlled soldier. 
        Romanoff also discovers that she cannot harm Dreykov due to a pheromone lock he installed in every Widow,
        and that he has been controlling Widows all around the world via his control desk. Romanoff intentionally breaks her own nose,
        which severs a nerve in her nasal passage to negate the pheromone, allowing her to attack Dreykov.

        Dreykov escapes as the Widows go after Romanoff, but Belova creates an antidote bomb that releases the Widows from mind control. 
        Romanoff accesses the control desk and copies the locations of the other Widows worldwide to a portable drive just as the facility begins to explode 
        and fall from the sky. Before leaving the control room, she picks up two vials of the antidote that survived Belova's bomb. 
        Romanoff gives Belova a parachute as she and Antonia have one final battle through the sky. 
        Landing on the ground, Romanoff uses one vial of the antidote on Antonia, freeing her from servitude. 
        The rest of the Widows arrive as Belova, Vostokoff, 
        and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff and she gives Belova the last antidote vial and the portable drive, 
        telling her to find and free the other Widows. As they leave, Romanoff awaits the arrival of Ross and his men. Two weeks later, 
        Romanoff reunites with Mason who has supplied her with a Quinjet. She departs to meet with her fugitive teammates.
      </p>
      <h4>Infinity War</h4>
      <p>
        In 2018, Romanoff, Rogers, and Wilson arrive in Edinburgh to defend Maximoff and Vision from Corvus Glaive and Proxima Midnight, 
        two of Thanos' adopted children. Romanoff wounds Glaive with his own weapon when she stabs him in the abdomen and both he and Midnight retreat. 
        Romanoff chastises Maximoff for not frequently checking in and they return to the Compound, 
        reuniting with Rhodes and Banner. 
        After discussing Vision and the Mind Stone, they travel to Wakanda in hopes the Stone can be removed safely by Shuri. 
        Romanoff joins in the battle against the Outriders and witnesses Thor, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot's arrival. 
        She and Okoye are saved from Threshers by Maximoff, before teaming up to defend Maximoff from Midnight.
        After the battle is over, she witnesses Thanos arrive, but is incapacitated by his usage of the Reality Stone. 
        She survives the Blip and is left defeated.
        She, Banner, Rogers, Rhodes, Thor, and Rocket return to the Compound and shortly after, 
        meet Carol Danvers.[e] Later, she and the others witness Danvers return with the Benatar, 
        bringing Stark and Nebula to the Compound. Romanoff then gives a briefing on the Blip, before learning Thanos' location from Nebula. 
        She, Rocket, Danvers, Nebula, Rogers, Thor, Banner, and Rhodes then travel into space via the Benatar to find him.
        They go to the Garden planet where they learn Thanos destroyed the stones, much to their dismay, and Thor decapitates him.
      </p>
      <h4>Time Heist And Death</h4>
      <p>
        In 2023, Romanoff, who is living at the Avengers Compound, leads the Avengers, now including Rocket, Nebula, and Danvers.
        She tells Rhodes to keep looking for Barton, who lost his family in the Blip and spent the last few years killing members of organized crime 
        across the world. 
        She and Rogers are astonished when Lang, whom they believed had disappeared, 
        arrives at the Compound and tells them that he has been trapped in the Quantum Realm, a place where time passes differently.
        Romanoff, Rogers, and Lang present the idea of using the Realm to obtain the Stones from the past to Stark at his cabin, 
        but he refuses to help. They meet Banner at a diner, who has permanently assumed the Hulk form, and he agrees to help them. However, 
        they fail to send Lang back in time successfully using the portable Quantum Tunnel in Lang's borrowed van at the Compound.
        Romanoff travels in the Quinjet to Tokyo where she reunites with Barton, after witnessing him murder the Yakuza leader. 
        She convinces him to return to the Compound. After Rocket, Nebula, and Thor arrive,
        Romanoff checks on Barton after he does a test run of Stark and Rocket's newly built Quantum Tunnel and learns that he was successful 
        in returning to his house in another timeline. Romanoff and the team brainstorm a plan to obtain all six Infinity Stones from alternate timelines. 
        She, Barton, Rhodes, and Nebula travel the Realm to an alternate 2014 timeline and arrive on the planet Morag, before 
        she and Barton leave in the Benatar for the planet Vormir. They encounter 
        the Red Skull who reveals a life sacrifice is needed to obtain the Soul Stone.
        Romanoff tries to stop Barton from sacrificing himself, ultimately subduing him, and falling to her death.
      </p>
      <h4>Legacy</h4>
      <p>
        Banner, Barton, Rogers, Stark, and Thor grieve Romanoff's death privately outside the Compound. Her sacrifice is not in vain however, 
        as Banner successfully undoes the Blip, restoring half of all life in the universe. 
        Barton and Maximoff discuss Romanoff's sacrifice and his desire to let her know they won.
        In 2024, students at Parker's school,
        Midtown School of Science and Technology, make a tribute video respecting those who had fallen, including Romanoff.
        In December 2024, Belova visits Romanoff's grave in Ohio to pay her respects, 
        before being assigned by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine to assassinate Barton, whom De Fontaine deems responsible for Romanoff's death.[81] 
        Also in December 2024, Barton visits New York City with his family for Christmas and attends a Broadway theatre performance of Rogers: 
        The Musical, which depicts Romanoff during the 2012 Battle of New York. Barton suffers flashbacks of Romanoff's death. 
        As Barton opens up to Kate Bishop about Romanoff, she deduces that he is Ronin. Belova arrives and tries to kill Barton, 
        but is stopped by Bishop. She later confronts Bishop and informs her that she intends to kill Barton to avenge her sister's death. 
        Barton visits a memorial to the assembling of the Avengers where he verbalizes aloud that he misses her. When Belova confronts Barton, 
        they fight, but Barton successfully explains that Romanoff sacrificed herself to save the world and explains his close relationship with her.
        An emotional Belova spares Barton's life and leaves.
