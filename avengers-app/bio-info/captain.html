  <h4>Origin</h4>
    <p>
     Steve Rogers was born on July 4, 1918, in Brooklyn, New York, to Joseph and Sarah Rogers. 
     His father, a member of the 107th Infantry Regiment, was killed by mustard gas during World War I. 
     He was raised by his mother, a nurse, who died of tuberculosis, leaving Rogers alone at the age of eighteen.
     At just 5-foot-4-inch (1.63 m) tall and weighing only 90 pounds (41 kg),
     Rogers was also afflicted with a number of medical issues including asthma, scoliosis, heart arrhythmia, partial deafness, stomach ulcers, 
     and pernicious anemia.
    </p>
       <h4>Becoming Captain America And Battling Hydra</h4>
     <p>
      At the outset of World War II, Rogers attempts to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces but is repeatedly rejected due to his numerous health problems.
      In 1942, while attending the Stark Expo with his best friend, James Barnes,
      Rogers again attempts to enlist. Dr. 
      Abraham Erskine overhears Rogers speaking with Barnes and approves his enlistment due to his continued efforts to serve his country
      despite his physical handicaps.
      He is recruited into the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) as part of a super-soldier experiment under Erskine, 
      U.S. Army Colonel Chester Phillips, and British MI6 agent Peggy Carter. 
      The night before the treatment, Erskine reveals to Rogers that Nazi officer Johann Schmidt, head of the science division called Hydra,
      underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered permanent side-effects. Nonetheless, 
      Rogers agrees to the treatment and is injected with Erskine's serum and doused with vita-rays. 
      After Rogers emerges significantly taller and more muscular, an undercover assassin kills Erskine and flees. 
      Rogers, using his remarkable speed and strength increase, pursues and captures the assassin,
      who reveals he is a Hydra agent and commits suicide with a cyanide capsule. With Erskine dead and the formula lost, U.S.
      Senator Brandt takes advantage of the media hype around Rogers'
      actions and has him tour the nation in a colorful costume with the title of Captain America to promote the sale of war bonds.

      While on tour in Italy, Rogers learns that the 107th Barnes' unit was MIA in a battle against Schmidt's forces.
      Rogers asks Carter and engineer Howard Stark to fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt. 
      Rogers infiltrates the Hydra facility, freeing Barnes and 400 other prisoners.
      Rogers confronts Schmidt, who reveals himself to be the "Red Skull" and escapes. 
      Despite disobeying orders, Rogers is rewarded for his heroics and is formally promoted to the rank of Captain. 
      He recruits Barnes and several other elite soldiers, 
      who were among the prisoners he rescued, to form a team called the Howling Commandos to attack other Hydra bases.
      Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a circular shield made of vibranium, a rare, nearly indestructible metal.
      Over the next two years, 
      Rogers and the Howling Commandos help to turn the tide of the war in favor of the Allies.
      The team eventually captures top Hydra scientist Dr. Arnim Zola on a train, but Barnes falls to his presumed death during the battle. 
      Using information extracted from Zola, 
      Rogers leads an attack on the final Hydra stronghold to stop Schmidt from using weapons of mass destruction on major American cities.
      Rogers infiltrates the final Hydra base with the help of the SSR,
      including Carter who reveals her mutual romantic feelings toward Rogers and the two share a kiss before Schmidt escapes in an aircraft 
      carrying the weapons and is pursued by Rogers. 
      During the confrontation, the source of Hydra's advanced weapons, the Tesseract, 
      is physically handled by Schmidt causing him to vanish within a bright light.
      The Tesseract is lost in the ocean and with no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating the bombs, 
      Rogers reluctantly bids farewell to Carter via the plane's communications system and crashes it and himself in the Arctic.
      </p>
      <h4>Adjusting To The Modern Era And The Battle Of New York</h4>
      <p>
       In 2011, Rogers awakens in a 1940s-style hospital room. Deducing from an anachronistic baseball radio broadcast that something is wrong,
       he flees outside and finds himself in present-day Times Square, where S.H.I.E.L.D. 
       director Nick Fury informs him that he has been frozen in suspended animation for nearly 70 years.
       
       Rogers learns that most of his World War II-era comrades are deceased, 
       and he struggles to adjust to the modern world. In 2012, he is approached by Fury, who has activated the "Avengers Initiative", 
       with an assignment to retrieve the stolen Tesseract from Loki. 
       Rogers agrees and is introduced to Natasha Romanoff and Bruce Banner by Phil Coulson.
       In Stuttgart, Rogers and Loki have a brief physical confrontation until Tony Stark arrives, resulting in Loki's surrender.
       While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D. on the Quinjet, his brother Thor arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan.
       After a confrontation between Thor, Stark, and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier.
       The Avengers become divided,
       both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons much like Hydra had in 
       the 1940s.
       Agents possessed by Loki, including Clint Barton, attack the Helicarrier, 
       disabling one of its engines in flight, which Stark and Rogers work together to restart. Loki escapes,
       and Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth.
       Rogers recruits Barton to join the Avengers after he is freed from his mind control by Romanoff. 
       Loki uses the Tesseract to open a wormhole in New York City above Stark Tower, allowing the alien army of the Chitauri to invade. 
       Rogers successfully leads the Avengers in defending the city and they defeat and capture Loki.
       Following the battle, Rogers coordinates the search and rescue of injured civilians. 
       Thor returns Loki to Asgard to face justice for his invasion and the Avengers go their separate ways. 
       Rogers, with newfound purpose in the modern world, rides off on his motorcycle.
       Sometime afterwards, Rogers records a number of public service announcements for high school students,
       encouraging them to do things like maintain healthy lifestyles, obey rules, and practice patience.
      </p>
      <h4>Dismantling Hydra And Fighting The Winter Soldier</h4>
      <p>
      In 2014, Rogers works for S.H.I.E.L.D. in Washington, D.C. under Fury, while continuing to adjust to contemporary society. 
      Rogers and Romanoff are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s counter-terrorism S.T.R.I.K.E. team, led by Brock Rumlow, 
      to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. satellite launch vessel, 
      the Lemurian Star, that has been hijacked by a terrorist group led by Georges Batroc. Rogers and S.T.R.I.K.E successfully rescue the hostages, 
      but Batroc escapes when Rogers discovers Romanoff has her own agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for Fury. 
      Rogers returns to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, 
      to confront Fury and is briefed about Project Insight:
      three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites designed to preemptively eliminate threats against America. 
      Rogers, citing his moral issues with such a program, expresses concern that the project will likely result in the deaths of innocent people.
      He visits an elderly Carter who expresses regret that Rogers never got to live the life he deserved.

      Unable to decrypt the data recovered by Romanoff, 
      Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce to delay the project.
      Fury, ambushed by assailants led by the Winter Soldier, escapes and warns Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised.
      Fury is gunned down by the Winter Soldier, but hands Rogers a flash drive containing Romanoff's data.
      Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion, 
      revealing evidence that Fury hired Batroc to hijack the ship as cover to retrieve the data,
      but when Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., 
      Rogers escapes capture and meets with Romanoff. Using the data, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. 
      bunker below Camp Leigh, Rogers' old military training base in New Jersey, 
      where they activate a supercomputer containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola.
      Zola reveals that after S.H.I.E.L.D. 
      was founded following World War II, 
      Hydra has secretly operated within its ranks and creating world crisis that will eventually cause humanity to sacrifice freedom for security. 
      A S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and the pair realize that Pierce is Hydra's leader.

      Rogers and Romanoff enlist the help of former USAF pararescueman Sam Wilson, whom Rogers befriended earlier, and acquire his powered "Falcon" wingpack.
      Deducing that S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jasper Sitwell is a Hydra mole,
      they force him to divulge Hydra's plan to use satellite-guided guns to eliminate individuals identified by an algorithm as a threat to Hydra.
      They are ambushed by the Winter Soldier, whom Rogers recognizes as Barnes. S.H.I.E.L.D.
      operative Maria Hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, who faked his death, 
      is waiting with plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips. 
      After the World Security Council members arrive for the Helicarriers' launch,
      Rogers exposes Hydra's plot causing an internal conflict within S.H.I.E.L.D.
      Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, 
      but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. 
      Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to have the vessels destroy each other. 
      Rogers refuses to fight the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion,
      Rogers is thrown into the Potomac River. Barnes rescues the unconscious Rogers and departs.
      S.H.I.E.L.D. officially disbands and after Rogers recovers from his injuries, he and Wilson partner together to find Barnes.
     </p>
     <h4>Leading The Avengers And Combating Ultron</h4>
      <p>
      In 2015, in the Eastern European country of Sokovia, Rogers leads the Avengers against a Hydra facility to recover Loki's scepter. 
      They are attacked by the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, two superhuman experimental volunteers. 
      The Avengers succeed in obtaining the scepter and Rogers captures Hydra leader Baron Strucker. Returning to the Avengers Tower,
      Stark and Banner use the scepter to complete Stark's "Ultron" global defense program. Afterwards, 
      the Avengers host a celebratory party and Ultron reveals himself and attacks the team at the Avengers Tower, before escaping. 
      In Johannesburg, the Avengers confront and battle Ultron, Wanda, and Pietro. Rogers is subdued by Wanda after she produces hallucinatory visions.
      After Maximoff also causes the Hulk to ravage the city before being subdued by Stark,
      Rogers and the other defeated Avengers take refuge at Barton's safe house so they can recover. While there, 
      they are encouraged by Fury to assemble and stop Ultron.

      In Seoul, Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton attempt to stop Ultron from uploading his network into a synthetic vibranium body powered by the Mind Stone. 
      Rogers fights Ultron in an attempt to keep him from completing the upload.
      He is assisted by the Maximoff twins who side with the Avengers after learning Ultron plans to exterminate humanity.
      They retrieve the synthetic body, but Romanoff is captured. 
      At Avengers Tower,
      the Avengers have a dispute over the synthetic body which is activated and becomes Vision. Rogers and the Avengers then return to Sokovia,
      where they engage in a battle against Ultron and are able to defeat him, 
      but at the cost of Pietro's life and the complete destruction of the city. At the new Avengers Compound in Upstate New York,
      Rogers and Romanoff begin training new team members: Wanda, James Rhodes, Vision, and Wilson.
      </p>
      <h4>Sokovian Accords</h4>
      <p>
      In 2016, Rogers, Maximoff, Romanoff, and Wilson stop Rumlow, now working as a mercenary, from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in Lagos.
      Rumlow attempts to kill Rogers with a suicide bomb, but Maximoff saves him.
      However, she accidentally kills several Wakandan humanitarian workers in the process. 
      This leads to U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross informing the Avengers that the United Nations is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords,
      which will establish a U.N. panel to oversee and control the team. 
      The Avengers are divided: Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, 
      while Rogers is hesitant to give the government that kind of control over the team.

      Helmut Zemo, seeking to destroy the Avengers as revenge for the death of his family in Sokovia, tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, 
      stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' Winter Soldier brainwashing. 
      Barnes is framed for the Vienna bombing that kills King T'Chaka of Wakanda, and T'Chaka's son T'Challa, the Black Panther, vows vengeance.
      Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to Bucharest and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but are apprehended.
      Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo sends Barnes on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and hides him. 
      When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base,
      where other brainwashed "Winter Soldiers" are kept in cryogenic stasis.
      Rogers and Wilson go rogue; they recruit Barton, Scott Lang, and Maximoff to their cause. 
      Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, Rhodes, Vision, T'Challa, and Peter Parker to capture the rogue Avengers. 
      They fight at Leipzig/Halle Airport in Germany, until Romanoff helps Rogers and Barnes escape.
      Stark strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes after finding out about Zemo,
      but Zemo reveals footage of an automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 that contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. 
      Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them. 
      After an intense fight, Rogers disables Stark's Iron Man armor and departs with Barnes, leaving his shield behind.
      Rogers breaks his team out of the Raft, and heads to Wakanda with Barnes, 
      where Barnes chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. Wanted by the U.N.
      for breaking the Sokovia Accords, Rogers, Maximoff, Romanoff, and Wilson go into hiding,
      while Barton and Lang strike a deal with the government for house arrest so that they can be with their families.
      </p>
      <h4>Infinity War</h4>
      <p>
       In 2018, Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson rescue Maximoff and Vision in Scotland from Corvus Glaive and Proxima Midnight, two of Thanos' children.
       They return to the Avengers Compound, reuniting with Banner and Rhodes.
       Rhodes refuses Secretary Ross's order to arrest Rogers, Romanoff, Wilson, and Maximoff; 
       and Rogers informs Ross they intend to defend the Earth against the incoming threat, with or without permission from the Sokovia Accords. 
       Rogers and the team travel to Wakanda to have Shuri remove the Mind Stone from Vision without destroying him in the process. 
       Rogers orders Maximoff to destroy the Stone as soon as it is removed from his head. As Thanos' children and the Outriders invade the battlefield,
       Rogers, Barnes, Romanoff, Wilson, Rhodes, Banner, T'Challa, and the Wakandan armies mount a defense and get support when Thor,
       Rocket Raccoon, and Groot arrive. Rogers attempts to rally the Avengers against Thanos who successfully destroys Vision, obtains the Mind Stone,
       and completes the Infinity Gauntlet. Rogers survives the Blip, but is left defeated.

       Returning to the Compound, Rogers and Romanoff assess the worldwide casualties and discover that Thanos destroyed half of all living things.
       They are met by Carol Danvers, who arrives answering Fury's pager. Sometime after, Rogers shaves his beard, before hearing the Benatar arrive. 
       He, Romanoff, Rhodes, Banner, Rocket, and Pepper Potts go outside and see Danvers bringing Stark and Nebula to the Compound. After making a plan,
       Rogers leads Rocket, Danvers, Thor, Romanoff, Rhodes, Banner, and Nebula into space on the Benatar to hunt Thanos at his garden planet.
       They confront and subdue Thanos and are horrified to learn that he destroyed the stones to prevent his mission from ever being undone. 
       A defeated Rogers watches an enraged Thor decapitate Thanos.
      </p>
      <h4>Avenging The Fallen</h4>
      <p>
       In 2023, Rogers leads a support group for grieving survivors in New York City, while living at the Avengers Compound. 
       One day, Rogers and Romanoff are shocked when Lang arrives at the Compound and explains that he has been trapped in the Quantum Realm and
       suggests using it as a form of time travel. Rogers, Romanoff, and Lang visit Stark at his lakeside cabin but he refuses to help. 
       They meet Banner at a diner who agrees, however, their initial attempts at time travel are unsuccessful. Stark returns to the Compound, 
       revealing he has unlocked the key to successful time travel, and he and Rogers conclude their nearly decade-long feud,
       reestablishing their trust in one another with Stark returning Rogers' shield. After Barton, Thor, Rhodes, Rocket,
       and Nebula return to the Compound, the team formulates a plan and Rogers teams up with Stark, Banner, 
       and Lang to travel to an alternate 2012 to retrieve the three Stones present in New York City during Loki's invasion 
       They succeed in securing the Time Stone and the Mind Stone, with Rogers having to fight his alternate 2012 version of himself to facilitate this.
       However, after the Space Stone plan goes awry, it necessitates a trip to 1970 so that Stark can recover it from a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in New Jersey, while Rogers finds Pym Particles at the same base for their trip back. While in the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Rogers sees the 1970 version of Peggy Carter through a window. The Avengers return, save for Romanoff who sacrificed herself for the mission, and the original Avengers hold a silent mourning for her. After Rocket, Stark, and Banner create a gauntlet, Banner reverses the Blip. However, an alternate Thanos from his 2014 timeline emerges from the quantum realm and attacks the Compound.

       Rogers, Stark and Thor engage Thanos and during the fight, Rogers proves worthy to wield Thor's hammer Mjolnir.
       Thanos proves too powerful and Rogers, bruised and battered with his shield in tatters, stands up alone to face Thanos and his entire army.
       However, the restored Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Wakandan army,
       Masters of the Mystic Arts, Ravagers, and Asgardians arrive and Rogers rallies them all in a final battle against Thanos. During the battle,
       Rogers witnesses Danvers' return. With no other options for victory, Stark steals the Infinity Stones from Thanos and snaps his fingers.
       Thanos and his army disintegrate, and Stark dies while Rogers looks on in grief.

       After attending Stark's funeral, Rogers reunites with Barnes, Wilson, 
       and Banner before returning the Infinity Stones and Mjolnir to their appropriate timelines. 
       However, Rogers also decides to visit an alternate 1949 to reunite with Carter,[41] where he marries and lives a full life with her. 
       Returning to Barnes, Wilson, and Banner, he appears as an elderly man finally at peace, and passes his shield and mantle to Wilson.
      </p>
      <h4>Legacy</h4>
      <p>
      In spring 2024, Wilson struggles with the idea of taking up Rogers' title as Captain America and instead gives the shield to the U.S.
      government so it can be displayed in a Smithsonian museum exhibit dedicated to Rogers. 
      Joaquin Torres mentions to Wilson that discussions about Rogers' whereabouts have become an internet conspiracy theory, 
      and a common one is that he is hidden in a secret moonbase. The government names John Walker as the new Captain America and gives him the shield.
      
      Barnes confronts Wilson, who reveals that he did not feel comfortable being Rogers' successor.
      Walker indicates his desire to fill Rogers' shoes but comes into conflict with Wilson and Barnes,
      who refuse to work with him and the Global Repatriation Council (GRC) in tracking down the Flag Smashers, a group of terrorist super soldiers.
      Barnes introduces Wilson to Isaiah Bradley, an African-American successor to Rogers that he came into conflict with during the Korean War. 
      Bradley was kept a secret (even from Rogers), imprisoned for thirty years, and experimented on by the government and Hydra.
      Wilson and Barnes learn that Bradley's blood was used to create a new variation of the Super Soldier
      Serum for the Power Broker but was stolen and used by the Flag Smashers. Helmut Zemo destroys all but one of the remaining vials of the serum,
      which is secretly retrieved by Walker, who uses it and gains super soldier abilities. 
      Walker murders a Flag Smasher with the shield while a horrified crowd watches and records him. 
      Wilson and Barnes forcibly take the shield from Walker, who has the Captain America title stripped from him by the government.
      Wilson eventually takes up the mantle as Rogers intended. 
      Wilson, with assistance from Barnes, Walker, and Sharon Carter, defeats the Flag Smashers, 
      and Wilson convinces the GRC to end its forced resettlement practices. 
      Wilson later has a memorial dedicated to Isaiah Bradley added to the Captain America museum exhibit.

      Students at Midtown School of Science and Technology create a tribute video, with Rogers being included.
      That same year, the Statue of Liberty is modified and undergoes construction to replace the torch with Captain America's shield.
      Additionally, a Broadway theatre production entitled Rogers: The Musical is created as an homage to Rogers. While Barton is in New York City,
       he attends the musical with his family and is displeased with the musical's upbeat depiction of the Battle of New York.
      A memorial plaque commemorating the first assembling of the Avengers is seen by the Grand Central Terminal, and as the leader, 
      Rogers' name is on the top of the memorial.[44] In 2025, a statue of Rogers is seen at the entrance of AvengerCon at the rebuilt Camp Lehigh.
