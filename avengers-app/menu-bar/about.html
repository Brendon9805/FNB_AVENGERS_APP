   <h2 class="header-info">The Avengers</h2>

   <div class="Detailed-info">
   <h4>The Avengers Initiative</h4>
   <p>
    In 1995, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury creates the Avengers Initiative, envisioning it as a group of heroes working to respond to planetary threats, 
    following the appearance of Carol Danvers and naming it after her U.S. Air Force callsign, "Avenger".
    Years later, Fury assesses various individuals for it, including Tony Stark and Steve Rogers.
    Stark's membership is declined after a negative report by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Natasha Romanoff.
    The World Security Council wanted Emil Blonsky to join, but rejected it after Stark deters Thaddeus Ross from the idea,
    hiring Bruce Banner instead.
    </p>
    <h4>The First Assembly</h4>
    <p>
      In 2012, the Asgardian Loki teleports to the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility on Earth,
      where he steals the Tesseract and brainwashes Clint Barton and Dr. 
      Erik Selvig using his scepter. Subsequently, Fury recruits Stark and Banner to locate the Tesseract. 
      Rogers, Romanoff, and Stark apprehend Loki, but are disrupted by Thor's arrival. This leads to confrontations between the group,
      exacerbated by the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. is using the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction. Barton attacks the Helicarrier,
      causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and cause damage. After Loki kills S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, the team unites to avenge him, 
      with Romanoff freeing Barton from the scepter's control. Rogers then recruits Barton to the team as a new member. The Avengers confront Loki, 
      who opens a wormhole using the Tesseract and begins an invasion with his Chitauri army, starting a battle.
      Stark introduces the team to Loki by referring to them as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".
      Eventually, the World Security Council launches a nuclear missile towards Manhattan, but Stark intercepts and flies it through the wormhole, 
      destroying the Chitauri mother ship and stopping the invasion. Romanoff closes the portal with the scepter and the team apprehends Loki, 
      who is taken back to Asgard.
    </p>
    <h4>Fighting Ultron</h4>
    <p>
     Three years after the Battle of New York, Hydra uses Loki's scepter following their infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D.
     The Avengers locate it in Sokovia, where they recover it and encounter twin superhuman Hydra test subjects,
     Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Barton is wounded and Rogers captures Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker while Stark retrieves the scepter, 
     despite being subjected to hallucinations by Wanda's telepathy. 
     Stark and Banner unilaterally decide to use the scepter to create the Ultron Program, a sentient artificial intelligence (AI) peacekeeping force.
     However, Ultron resolves to eradicate humanity. 
     In Africa, the Avengers fight Ultron, now allied with the Maximoffs. Wanda induces telekinetic hallucinations, triggering Banner's
     transformation into the Hulk before Barton stops her, while Stark stops Hulk's rampage with his Hulkbuster armor. After reconvening at Barton's
     farmhouse, Rogers, Barton, and Romanoff retrieve a new vibranium body created by Ultron.
     Stark and Banner use it to create Vision, a sentient and benevolent being powered from the Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S. program, Mjolnir, 
     and the Mind Stone. Ultron tries to use Sokovia as a meteor to cause an extinction event. 
     The Avengers, joined by James Rhodes and the Maximoffs, defeat Ultron's sentries and evacuate civilians.
     Pietro sacrifices himself to save Barton, while Stark and Thor destroy Sokovia, and Vision fully terminates Ultron to avert the event. 
     In the aftermath, Stark and Barton retire, Banner disappears, and Thor decides to find the Infinity Stones, while Rhodes, Sam Wilson, Wanda, 
     and the Vision join the team. The Avengers relocate their primary headquarters to the Avengers Compound in Upstate New York.
    </p>
    <h4>Civil War</h4>
    <p>
      Months after the Battle of Sokovia, the Avengers' new facility becomes targeted in a heist, with a skirmish between Wilson and Scott Lang.
      In 2016, Rogers, Romanoff, Maximoff, and Wilson defend a research lab in Lagos from Brock Rumlow. 
      They successfully stop Rumlow and his crew of mercenaries, but Maximoff's usage of telekinesis to try to save civilians kills Wakandan diplomats.
      Thus, United States Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross presents the Sokovia Accords, 
      United Nations (U.N.) legislation intended to regulate superhumans' activities. 
      The Avengers are divided: Stark, Rhodes, Vision, and Romanoff support it, while Rogers and Wilson object due to fears of authoritarianism.

      After Bucky Barnes is accused of killing Wakandan King T'Chaka,
      Rogers and Wilson protect him from an arrest warrant, causing them to clash with Stark,
      Rhodes, Romanoff, and T'Challa, son of T'Chaka who was killed in Lagos.
      After Barnes is detained, Helmut Zemo activates Barnes' Winter Soldier persona using the Winter Soldier Book, 
      although Barnes later recovers and reveals Zemo's interest in the Winter Soldier Program.
      To aid them, Wilson and Rogers recruit Lang and Barton, then take Maximoff out of confinement at the Avengers Compound. 
      The divided Avengers meet and fight at the Leipzig/Halle Airport; Rogers, Wilson, Barton, Maximoff, Barnes and Lang clash with Stark, Rhodes,
      Romanoff, Vision, T'Challa and new recruit Peter Parker.
      Rogers and Barnes escape with Romanoff's help, traveling to the Hydra Siberian Facility to stop Zemo from reactivating the Winter Soldier Program.
      Their teammates are imprisoned in the Raft and Rhodes' legs are paralyzed after accidentally being struck by Vision's blast.
      Stark joins Rogers and Barnes after realizing Barnes' innocence, but fights them after Zemo reveals Barnes' assassination of Stark's parents.
      In the fight, Rogers disables Stark's armor and Barnes' cybernetic arm is destroyed. 
      Rogers then abandons his shield. Meanwhile, T'Challa apprehends Zemo, realizing him to be T'Chaka's killer.
      Rogers later frees his teammates from the Raft, becoming fugitives.
      Barton and Lang agree to be under house arrest to be with their families. Although officially reduced to just Stark, Vision, and Rhodes, 
      the Avengers continue operating. Stark offers to hire Parker after he defeats Adrian Toomes. 
      However, Parker declines, choosing to remain as Spider-Man, but promises to assist the Avengers if needed.
      In 2018, Wade Wilson / Deadpool travels from his universe, 
      Earth-10005, to Earth-616 / the "Sacred Timeline" hoping to join the Avengers and give his life added meaning. He is interviewed by Happy Hogan,
      who rejects him, and returns to his own universe.
    </p>
    <h4>The Blip</h4>
    <p>
      In 2018, the Avengers come into conflict with Thanos and his children, who seek the six Infinity Stones to erase half of the universe's life.
      Thanos hijacks a spaceship containing Asgardian refugees, killing Loki and subduing Thor.
      Thanos defeats Hulk, who is transported to Earth by Heimdall to inform Stephen Strange, the keeper of the Time Stone, of Thanos' arrival.
      Banner, Strange, and Wong, joined by Stark and Parker, confront two of his children in Greenwich Village. 
      With Banner unable to transform to aid in the fight, Strange is captured and taken to their spaceship, 
      while Banner warns Rogers of Thanos' intention to acquire Vision's Mind Stone.
      Stark and Parker pursue Strange and board the spaceship, where Stark officially anoints Parker as an Avenger. They go to Titan to confront Thanos,
      allying with the Guardians of the Galaxy along the way. 
      The two teams temporarily restrain Thanos in an ensuing battle to take his Infinity Gauntlet off, now with four Stones.
      However, Peter Quill hits Thanos after learning he killed Gamora, freeing and allowing Thanos to incapacitate the group.
      With Thanos preparing to kill Stark, Strange surrenders the Time Stone to save his life.

      Meanwhile, Maximoff and Vision, now in a relationship and hiding out in Edinburgh, are ambushed by two more of Thanos' children, 
      resulting in Vision getting wounded. Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson arrive and help. 
      Returning to the Avengers Compound, they meet Rhodes and Banner to discuss Thanos. 
      Vision proposes to be destroyed to prevent Thanos from acquiring the Mind Stone, but Maximoff refuses and the team travels to Wakanda, 
      where Shuri begins an operation to safely remove the Stone. The Wakandan army, their allies,
      and Barnes aid the Avengers to repel an invasion by Thanos' children. 
      Thor arrives on the battlefield alongside Rocket and Groot through the Bifrost after forging his new Stormbreaker axe on Nidavellir. 
      Shuri is ambushed, stopping the operation, but the Avengers eventually kill Thanos' children. When Thanos arrives, 
      the Avengers delay him while Maximoff kills Vision to destroy the Mind Stone. 
      Maximoff is successful, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to undo her actions and retrieve the Stone,
      killing Vision again. With a full Gauntlet, Thanos initiates the Blip.
      Wilson, Barnes, Maximoff, Strange, Parker, T'Challa, Groot, Quill, Drax, and Mantis are blipped,
      leaving Stark and Nebula stranded on Titan while Thanos escapes.
      Fury and Maria Hill are blipped as they try to find the Avengers, but Fury manages to contact Danvers.
      Barton's family also are blipped, causing him to become the vengeful vigilante Ronin and murder criminals.
      Lang gets trapped in the Quantum Realm while harvesting energy, as Hank Pym, Hope, and Janet van Dyne get blipped prior to extracting him.
    </p>
    <h4>Reversing The Blip</h4>
    <p>
      Three weeks later, the Avengers reunite after Stark and Nebula are rescued by Danvers. 
      The Avengers find Thanos' location, where Rogers, Romanoff, Banner, Thor, Danvers, Rhodes, Rocket, and Nebula ambush him. 
      Thanos reveals he destroyed the Stones, prompting Thor to decapitate him.
      By 2023, Romanoff becomes the leader of the Avengers, officially recruiting Danvers, Rocket, and Nebula to the team. 
      The Avengers collaborate with Okoye to mitigate the Blip's damage. Rogers becomes a grief counselor, 
      Stark lives with his wife Pepper Potts and daughter Morgan, Thor becomes an overweight alcoholic afflicted with depression, 
      while Banner integrates his intelligence within the Hulk's body. Lang escapes the Quantum Realm and visits Rogers and Romanoff at the Compound, 
      proposing to use the Quantum Realm for time travel to undo the Blip. They visit Stark and Banner to discuss it, but Stark rejects it while Banner's
      tests with Pym's Quantum Tunnel fail. Stark eventually helps them, providing Pym Particles for time traveling.
      Banner and Rocket travel to New Asgard, Norway, to recruit Thor, while Romanoff recruits Barton in Tokyo. 
      They all reconvene and form a plan to conduct a time-traveling operation to retrieve each Stone from the best years and locations.
 
      Banner, Rogers, Stark, and Lang travel to New York City in 2012: Banner gets the Time Stone from the Ancient One after revealing Strange's
      surrendering of it, Rogers finds the Mind Stone in Loki's scepter, while Stark and Lang fail to get the Space Stone,
      but Stark and Rogers get it by going back to 1970. 
      Thor and Rocket retrieve the Reality Stone from Asgard in 2013, while Rhodes and Nebula retrieve the Power Stone from Morag in 2014.
      There, 2014-Thanos learns of the Blip and the Avengers' plan to undo it,
      so he kidnaps 2023-Nebula and replaces her with 2014-Nebula to sabotage the operation. 
      Barton gets the Soul Stone after Romanoff sacrifices herself on Vormir.
      Reuniting in 2023, the Avengers place the Stones into the newly made Nano Gauntlet. Then, Banner snaps with the gauntlet on,
      undoing the Blip. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula transports 2014-Thanos, his warship, and 2014-Gamora to 2023, destroying the Avengers Compound.
      2023-Nebula kills 2014-Nebula after failing to convince her to betray Thanos. 
      Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor, and Rogers and directs his army to obtain the Stones, intent on creating a new "grateful" universe. 
      Strange creates portals, allowing the restored Avengers and their allies to arrive to fight Thanos and his army.
      Maximoff overpowers Thanos and almost kills him, forcing him to call for his warship to fire missiles onto the ground.
      Danvers arrives and destroys the warship, but he knocks her out in a confrontation using the Power Stone and seizes the Nano Gauntlet.
      Stark confronts Thanos and steals the Stones from the Gauntlet with his armor, snapping his fingers to disintegrate Thanos and his army, 
      but the radiation kills Stark. After the battle, Fury sends Skrulls to collect blood samples on the battlefield, including some of the Avengers, 
      combining it into one concoction known as the Harvest.
    </p>
    <h4>Disbandment</h4>
    <p>
      The Avengers and their allies attend Stark's funeral at Stark's house. 
      Afterwards, they disband. Rogers travels back into the Quantum Realm to return 
      the Stones to their respective universes and then travels to another universe to live with Peggy Carter. 
      Rogers returns as an old man with a new shield and grants it and the title of Captain America to Wilson.
      Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new ruler of New Asgard and goes to space with the Guardians of the Galaxy.
      Maximoff goes to Florida and sees that Vision is in S.W.O.R.D. custody at their headquarters. 
      She then travels to Westview, New Jersey and in her grief over the trauma she endured throughout her life,
      recently with the loss of Vision and her home, the Avengers Compound, 
      creates a Hex trapping the town in a sitcom called WandaVision and creating twin boys and another Vision. 
      She learns she is the mythical Scarlet Witch and embraces her powers as such. Vision is reactivated by S.W.O.R.D.,
      through remnants of Maximoff's magic on a drone, and sports an all white appearance.

      Wilson returns to help out in the United States Air Force. 
      In 2024, with Barnes' reassurance, Wilson takes up the mantle of Captain America. 
      He gives his Falcon wings and mantle to his Air Force friend, Joaquin Torres. Also in 2024, 
      Banner and Danvers answer Wong's hologram call and meet Xu Shang-Chi. 
      They discuss the origins of the ten rings and discover that the rings are acting as a beacon to something. 
      Later that year, Banner aids his cousin Jennifer Walters after she receives his abilities following a blood cross-contamination in a car accident.
      Maximoff, having been in self-imposed isolation, becomes corrupted by the Darkhold and comes into conflict with Strange and Wong. 
      However, she ultimately breaks out of the corruption and destroys the Darkhold Castle, 
      along with every Darkhold copy. Barton returns to live with his family at their farm in Iowa.
      In December 2024, Barton and his children go to New York City before Christmas to see a Broadway musical about Rogers' legacy.
      While there, he meets Kate Bishop and her golden retriever, 
      Lucky. He takes her in as his protégé and they become Barton's extended family.

      In 2025, the first annual "AvengerCon" is held at Camp Lehigh to honor the Avengers.
      Lang becomes a celebrity while spending time with his daughter and the Pym family,
      starts the Big Me Little Me podcast, and writes his bestselling memoir Look Out for the Little Guy. 
      Banner travels to Sakaar to bring his son, Skaar, to Earth. 
      In 2026, Lang, his daughter Cassie, Hope, Pym, and Janet are transported into the Quantum Realm where they encounter Kang the Conqueror, 
      who forces Lang to help him escape. They successfully defeat Kang and return home. 
      However, the Council of Kangs, overseeing the multiverse outside of space and time,
      notes that Earth-616's Avengers are becoming more aware of the multiverse and must be stopped.
    </p>
    <h4>Restarting</h4>
    <p>
     In 2027, Wilson is asked by the new President of the United States, Thaddeus Ross, 
     to restart the Avengers. Wilson is initially reluctant to do so because of Ross's involvement in the Sokovia Accords,
      which not only caused the original team to be divided and disbanded but also partially led to the Blip, 
      and any governing oversight of the team would cause interference with their duties.
      However, Wilson accepts his responsibilities as Captain America and acknowledges that the world needs the Avengers to return. 

     He chooses Torres, the new Falcon, as his first recruit to join the new team.
     Later in 2027, Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 
     publicly rebrands the Thunderbolts team—consisting of 
     Yelena Belova, John Walker / U.S. Agent, Ava Starr / Ghost, Alexei Shostakov / Red Guardian and Barnes—as
     the New Avengers during a manipulated press conference, with Barnes serving as the leader.
     Fourteen months later in 2028, Wilson sues the team for copyright infringement for the name "New Avengers" after reinstating the original team.
